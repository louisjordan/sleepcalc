> :crescent_moon: a sleep cycle calculator

Feel groggy in the morning sometimes? That's called sleep inertia, it means you've woken up during a sleep cycle.

This calculator aims to help you avoid this by counting backwards in sleep cycles of 90 minutes to help you wake up feeling refreshed.

It works for me so why not try it? Let me know how it goes.
